# Timbó status report

## Graphic Report

#### Report Generator

[Usage instructions](https://danielpalme.github.io/ReportGenerator/usage.html) (generates the cli command)

``` bash
dotnet add package ReportGenerator
```

Make sure to include reportgenerator in your `.csproj`:

    <ItemGroup>
        <DotNetCliToolReference Include="dotnet-reportgenerator-cli" Version="4.0.4" />
      </ItemGroup>

In this case, I used the `Calculation.Tests.csproj` to produce the report for both projects (Calculation and PrimeService).
Apparently ReportGenerator just needs the xml files generated by `coverlet`.

Following https://medium.com/agilix/collecting-test-coverage-using-coverlet-and-sonarqube-for-a-net-core-project-ef4a507d4b28

Good Candidates:

0. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
1. [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) (comes in form of a Docker Image also) (can plugin from github)
2. [ReportGenerator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReportGenerator/4.0.4)

## Integrating with Visual Studio

For graphical display, I'm looking for a integration with visual studio,

Following
https://www.hanselman.com/blog/NETCoreCodeCoverageAsAGlobalToolWithCoverlet.aspx

https://dotnetthoughts.net/code-coverage-in-netcore-with-coverlet/
also seems useful

Tried installing [Coverage Gutters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ryanluker.vscode-coverage-gutters&WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha),
Tried renaming .vsix to .zip, extracting and tinkering with extension.vsixmanifest and back, did not work.

Failed on Visual Studio Professional 2017.
Works on Visual Studio **Code**.

![Coverage-Gutter](screenshots/vs-code-coverage-gutters.png)

[codecover](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradleymeck.codecover) as a second option to Coverage Gutters perhaps


[dotCover](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JetBrains.dotCover) also seems to be a solution that does not use coverlet, but it is paid.

# Original README.MD

# Unit testing using dotnet test sample

This sample is part of the [unit testing tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test) for creating applications with unit tests included. See that topic for detailed steps on the code for this sample.

## Key features

This sample demonstrates creating a library and writing effective unit tests that validate the features in that library. The example provides a service that indicates whether a number is prime.

## Restore and test

To run the tests, navigate to the *PrimeService.Tests* directory and type the following commands:

```
dotnet restore
dotnet test
```

`dotnet restore` restores the packages of both projects.
`dotnet test` builds both projects and runs all of the configured tests.
